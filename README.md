# 🏛️ Kleos — NFT Agent for Bankr

> *κλέος* — the Greek concept of eternal glory earned through heroic deeds.  
> **Kleos hunts NFT glory** — sweeping floors, sniping mints, managing portfolios, and claiming airdrops.

Kleos is a [Bankr](https://bankr.bot) skill that transforms your AI agent into a full-stack NFT trading machine. It works on Telegram, X (Twitter), and the Bankr web terminal — all through natural language.

## 📁 Memory System

Kleos saves state to your Bankr agent's persistent filesystem:

|------|---------|
| `/.memory/nft-activity.md` | Timestamped log of all buys, sells, mints, transfers |
| `/.memory/nft-watchlist.md` | Collections you're monitoring |
| `/.memory/nft-airdrops.md` | Airdrops you're tracking or have claimed |
| `/.memory/nft-targets.md` | Profit targets and stop losses for holdings |

## 🔗 Supported Chains

NFT operations are available on: **Base**, **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, **Unichain**

> 💡 Prefer **Base** — gas is sponsored by Bankr. Ethereum mainnet gas can exceed NFT value.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- A [Bankr](https://bankr.bot) account (free tier works, Bankr Club recommended for automations)
- NFT operations require sufficient ETH/WETH balance on the target chain
